| 1 | Found itertools with cycle() iterator                                                                          | https://github.com/filipux/adventofcode2018/blob/master/a1.nim  |
| 2 | toCountTable(seq) saved some typing - nice!                                                                    | https://github.com/filipux/adventofcode2018/blob/master/a2.nim  |
| 3 | Happy about how I could use an iterator for patches :)                                                         | https://github.com/filipux/adventofcode2018/blob/master/a3.nim  |
| 4 | Very hard. Learned about parseEnum[]() and attributes on enums                                                 | https://github.com/filipux/adventofcode2018/blob/master/a4.nim  |
| 5 | Started with string based regex solution but went with DoublyLinkedList for speed (0.1 seconds for both parts) | https://github.com/filipux/adventofcode2018/blob/master/a5.nim  |
| 6 | Hard problem. Inititally solved part #1 using a super fast flood fill technique but had to change to a slower method to solve part #2 with same code (0.2 sec for both parts).  | https://github.com/filipux/adventofcode2018/blob/master/a6.nim  |
| 7 | Graph problem that got a bit bloated. Why isn't there a Graph class in the Nim standard library? Tried out generics for the first time. Used strscans instead of regex to parse input. | https://github.com/filipux/adventofcode2018/blob/master/a7.nim  |
| 8 | Easier problem. readTree() turned out great, super happy about my code this time! Learned about seq.pop()| https://github.com/filipux/adventofcode2018/blob/master/a8.nim  |
| 9 | Easily solved using DoublyLinkedRing. ring.head.prev.prev.prev.prev.prev.prev.prev ðŸ˜„| https://github.com/filipux/adventofcode2018/blob/master/a9.nim  |
| 10 | Also quite easy. Hardest part was figuring out when to stop time and how to print the output| https://github.com/filipux/adventofcode2018/blob/master/a10.nim  |
